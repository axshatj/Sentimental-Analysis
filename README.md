#LSTM-Based Text Classification with GloVe Embeddings
##About the Project
This project involves developing an LSTM-based text classification model utilizing pre-trained GloVe word embeddings. 
The primary objective is to build an efficient and accurate model for binary text classification.
The project includes optimizing the model by conducting a grid search to determine the optimal number of training epochs, ensuring efficient training and preventing overfitting.
